# Customer-Segmentation

### Capstone Project, Data Science Masters Program (Simplilearn)

#### Problem Statement

It is a critical requirement for business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.

Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits.

Our objective here is to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).
